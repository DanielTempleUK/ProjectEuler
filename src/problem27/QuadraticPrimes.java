/**
 * Solution to problem 27:
 * 
 * Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
 * 
 * 		n + n + 41
 * 
 * It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 39.
 * However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and
 * certainly when n = 41, 41 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.
 * 
 * The incredible formula  n - 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for
 * the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126479.
 * 
 * Considering quadratics of the form:
 * 
 * 		n + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000
 * 
 * 		where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
 * 		e.g. |11| = 11 and |-4| = 4
 * Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the
 * maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
