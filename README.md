ProjectEuler
============

Solutions for the Project Euler problems that I done solved.
The code I produce is in java and is probably not the greatest ever produced, but the solutions do work and I try to explain what I'm doing in comments.

[Achieved level 3 by completing the first 75 problems. Very happy!](http://projecteuler.net/profile/DanTempleUK.png)

Solving the problems in numerical order, I'm finding some of these problems are really hard, and some are super easy.
It's a bizarre mixed bag, but it does keep it enjoyable and challenging.

I just solved a problem that less than 9000 people have solved! =D
