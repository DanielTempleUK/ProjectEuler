ProjectEuler
============

Solutions for the Project Euler problems that I done solved.

Achieved level 2 by completing the first 50 problems. Boom Town!
After my solution to problem 50 initially took 40 seconds to run I went through and tried to reduce the time of all of m solutions. I now aim for a run time of under 1 second.

Code I produce is in java and is probably not the greatest ever produced, but the solutions do work.
