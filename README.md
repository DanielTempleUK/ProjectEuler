ProjectEuler
============

Solutions for the Project Euler problems that I done solved.
Code I produce is in java and is probably not the greatest ever produced, but the solutions do work.

[Achieved level 2 by completing the first 50 problems. Boom Town!](http://projecteuler.net/profile/DanTempleUK.png)

Wow! These have gotten much harder since Problem 60.
Although I just solved my first puzzle that less than 10,000 people have solved. Quite happy with that.
